# Encouraging Excellence Society

We believe young-generation is the future of our society, country and the whole world. We help to make sure children have a bright future and lead a meaningful life so that they donâ€™t have to march on a unethical path. We help children especially from financially challenged background and provide them tools so that can lead a healthy professional and personal life. We provide guidance from peers in their locality to facilitate communication and mutual growth.
